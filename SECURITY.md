## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in HydroForge, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security concerns to the project maintainers
3. Include as much detail as possible:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: We will assess the vulnerability and determine its severity
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 7 days
- **Disclosure**: We will coordinate disclosure timing with you

### Scope

This security policy applies to:
- The HydroForge Julia package
- Official documentation
- Demo datasets and examples

### Out of Scope

- Third-party dependencies (report to their maintainers)
- Self-hosted instances with custom modifications

## Security Best Practices

When using HydroForge:

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate input data before simulation
2. **File Paths**: Be cautious with user-provided file paths
3. **Dependencies**: Keep Julia and dependencies updated
4. **Data Integrity**: Verify checksums of downloaded datasets

## Acknowledgments

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will acknowledge security researchers who help improve HydroForge.
